## What is this shiiiiiii?

I created this project to have some experience with database (MongoDB) and NextJS üê¶

## About

[Twixt](https://twixt.vercel.app)
It's a social-media (kinda) where users can send and recieve requests, post, comment, reply and message each other. This will build me a knowledge how many-to-many and one-to-many relationship works and how server-side-rendering, caching and other method of SSR techniques works.

See [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs) docs for more info.

## Deployment

This project is deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
